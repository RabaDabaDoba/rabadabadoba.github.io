## Introduction

The goal of this website is to have all my work regarding my Master Thesis at FOI collected at one place. 

I will continually make posts and add almost everything here as a platform for me to keep it organized. 

I am also new to coding in Markdown so this journey will be ugly, but hopefully in the end it will be lovely!


### What has been done today:

* Started planning in Draw.IO
* Integrated Draw.IO planning into this blog.
* Created this "blog"

See you tomorrow!
