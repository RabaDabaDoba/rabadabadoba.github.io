## Front page changes

The front page as of right now isn't really beautiful. What I want to add is to have two columns, the one to the left showing the most recent blog posts, and the right one having some introduction to the blog. I'm not sure if I want to add some type of picture to the start page or not, myabe it's just fine like it is now.

## Categories

Each post that I make can and most likely will have tags given to them. This will make it easy to see what a blog post is about. As well as it will be easy to follow my journey for certain areas of this project by follwing the tags. The name of the tags as well as their color is still work in progress, but I will eventually fix it so that it will be sufficient or the post that I will write.

## ToDo list

Since I have a lot to do and will have a lot of planning to do, it might be good to have a todo page that will work as a GIGANTIC to do list for everything. I'll have to think about that but something similar to it would be good to track progress!
