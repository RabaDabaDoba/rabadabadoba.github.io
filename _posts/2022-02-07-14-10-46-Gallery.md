## Gallery

During this project there will be a lot of pictures showing what is going on. What better way to show that than having a gallery contaning all the images. As of right now the gallery only shows pictures with no data connected to each picture. Ideally each picture should be connected to some post as well some other pages. Here's a short example of what it looks like:

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images" %}


## Tags

In adittion to adding a gallery, each post just like this one will have tags that summarizes the contents of a post. For example this post will be blog post, as well a post about web development for this website. Later on these tags will have color codings for certain areas of this project, like; Unity, report, theory, etc. 


## ToDo

I want to make it possible to link certain posts with each other such that if I do make coding post about a topic, then a couple of days later I make another post on the same topic as a couple of days ago. But between these posts I've posted about other stuff, so I should be able to see which posts comes next in time, but also regarding the topic.
